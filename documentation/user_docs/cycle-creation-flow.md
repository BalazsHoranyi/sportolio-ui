# Cycle Creation Flow

## What you can do

The planning page now includes a guided cycle-creation wizard to help you move from goals to executable weeks.

You can:

- Set macro-cycle start date and define one or more goals/events
- Explicitly choose the active priority goal
- Choose mesocycle strategy (`block`, `dup`, `linear`) and adjust parameters
- Edit microcycle details (count, focus, key sessions)
- Review soft warnings and suggested alternatives
- Review per-microcycle muscle-map summaries with workout drill-down links
- Save a draft and continue editing later

## How to use

1. Open the cycle creation section on the planning surface.
2. Complete **Goal & Event Setup**.
3. Continue to **Mesocycle Strategy** and set your strategy parameters.
4. Continue to **Microcycle Details** and configure weekly blocks.
5. Review warnings and alternatives in **Review**.
6. Review microcycle muscle-map summaries and use drill-down links to inspect mapped workouts.
7. Use **Save draft** at any time if you want to continue later.

## Validation behavior

- Required structural inputs are validated per step and block progression until fixed.
- Warnings are non-blocking and include alternatives you can choose to apply.
- High-overlap muscle indicators are visual-only and do not block progression.

## Scope

This is a web v1 planning feature. Mobile workout execution is out of scope here.
