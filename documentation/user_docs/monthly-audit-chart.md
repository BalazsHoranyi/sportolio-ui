# Monthly Audit Chart

The Monthly Audit Chart shows 30 days of fatigue trends so you can review mesocycle drift and load balance.

## What you see

- Three trend lines: Neural, Metabolic, Mechanical
- Recruitment as a shaded overlay band
- Red-zone threshold marker at `7.0` and above
- Planned/completed series styling parity:
  - Planned = dashed
  - Completed = solid

## How to use it

1. Open the audit chart window switcher and select `Month`.
2. Use `Previous month window` and `Next month window` to move across available month ranges.
3. Hover or focus day markers to inspect explainability links in the details panel.

## Notes

- Each month window requires a full 30-day payload.
- If month data is incomplete, the chart shows a validation message instead of partial chart output.
