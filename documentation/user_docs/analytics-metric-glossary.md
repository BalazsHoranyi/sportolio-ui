# Analytics Metric Glossary

Sportolo dashboards now include an in-product metric glossary so you can verify
what each metric means and where it comes from.

## Available dashboards

- `/dashboard/axis-fatigue`
- `/dashboard/adaptation-risk`
- `/dashboard/endurance-progress`
- `/dashboard/session-compliance`
- `/dashboard/block-effectiveness`

Each dashboard has a `Metric glossary` button near the top of the analytics
card.

## What the glossary shows

For each metric, the glossary includes:

- definition
- formula
- data lineage
- glossary version

## How to use it

1. Open one of the launch analytics dashboards.
2. Click `Metric glossary`.
3. Review the metric definition and formula before interpreting chart changes.
4. Use lineage details when validating source quality.
